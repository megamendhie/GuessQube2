# GuessQube2

How fast can you guess?

GuessQube is a fun and educating android game where users advance by guessing places, people or cartoon characters correctly.  It's timed so the player must be
fast.

GuessQube has 6 levels and you must enough points to advance to the next level. It's funny how players get tensed that they can't differentiate between
Chris Brown and Usher or between Ini Edo and Genevieve Nnaji.
